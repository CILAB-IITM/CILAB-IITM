We are a team of graduate and undergraduate students led by Prof. Kaushik Mitra. Together we explore the new paradigm of Computational Imaging. Traditionally, imaging optics design and image-based inference (image processing, computer vision) have been done independently. However, by jointly designing the imaging optics and inference algorithms, we can significantly enhance the performance of imaging systems which is the philosophy behind the fast evolving field of Computational Imaging.

Our research focuses on the following aspects of Computational Imaging (CI):

1. Develop novel CI systems
2. Develop theory to explore the performance limits of CI systems
3. Design deep learning algorithms for solving inverse problems in CI, image processing and computer vision
